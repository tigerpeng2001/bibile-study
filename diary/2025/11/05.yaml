grammar:
  passive_form:
    note:
      - "The passive form in Japanese is often created by adding specific endings to the verb stem, indicating that the subject is the recipient of an action."
      - "It is commonly used to express actions done to the subject rather than by the subject."
      - "However, in religious or respectful contexts (like speech about Jesus, kings, teachers, etc.), the passive form often functions as an honorific"
      - "— it doesnt mean 'was said (by someone)' but 'said (respectfully)'。"
    example:
      "言われた":
        - "It was said (the subject is receiving the action of being told)."
  suru_verbs:
    note:
      "Suru verbs are formed by combining a noun with the verb 'する' (to do). They are conjugated like regular verbs."
    example:
      "必要とする":
        - "to need (combining '必要' meaning 'need' with 'する')." 
  医者を必要とする:
    note:
      - "This phrase literally means 'to need a doctor,' where '医者' (doctor) is the object and '必要とする' (to need) is the verb."
      - "It illustrates the use of suru verbs in expressing necessity."
      - "'と' functions as a quotative/complement particle"
      - "AをBとする construction means 'to regard A as B', or 'to consider A to be B.', or 'to need A as B.'..."
    example:
      - "神を愛とする": "to regard God as love (literally 'to need God as love')."
      - "平和を目的とする": "to aim for peace (literally 'to have peace as the goal')."
